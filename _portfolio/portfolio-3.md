title: "Self-supervised learning approach for accelerating wireless network optimization"
excerpt: "In this project, we study the classic wireless multi-commodity network flow problem, where the network-layer routing issue
and link-layer scheduling issue are coupled together. We propose a self-supervised learning paradigm in which the scheduling structures (referring to the independent sets) of historical optimization experiences from a fixed network topology are smartly exploited to facilitate solving new instances with greatly reduced computational overhead. <br/><br/>

Optimization tasks in wireless networks can be generically formulated as scheduling link subsets (referred to as independent sets (IS)) that do not interfere with each other over the same communication channel. Just like graph coloring problems, finding the optimal set of ISs for multi-commodity flows in a wireless network is considered to belong to the class of NP-hard problems which is challenging to solve. We tackle the link scheduling-based optimization problem in a smart way by developing a self-supervised learning framework which follows a two-stage methodology.
